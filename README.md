## Challenge

1. timer
2. join button
3. current sentance
4. input
5. table


| Live progress      | Player name | Words per minute | Accuracy |
| :----------------- | :---------- | ---------------: | -------: |
| Lazy fox jumped \| | super typer |               30 |     0.97 |


1. Real-time updated results and player stats. When a player joins a competition he/she should be shown in the main player's table with other currently playing contestants. The table should show live data, for example "Live progress" column should show the currently typed-in text of the given player.
1. The game should consist of fixed-time rounds. In each round all currently playing people are presented with one sentence to type in. After the round time passes players are presented with the new sentence.
1. Show metrics and stats for the currently active players.
    - Words per minute - how fast the player correctly types in words. Words with errors shouldn't count.
    - Accuracy - how often the player hits the correct key. It should be the value of correctly typed-in characters to all characters in the given sentence. Feel free to extend the calculation if needed to handle edge cases.
1. Saving player results. When the same player joins the server their stats are loaded.
1. Presenting a simple loading/error states
1. Sorting the table by columns, pagination, and changing the number of rows displayed (locally).
1. Updating the current URL table sort, so we get the same sorting results when the page gets refreshed.
1. And adding anything else that you think will be useful for the user...

_Note: There are no formal "UX" designs for this exercise, so it's okay if it doesn't look polished._

## Realtime APIs

There are no strict requirements on the backend. Pick a tool that you feel will work best in this scenario. Keep in mind that it should work well with Next.js. It could be anything from self hosted server to a fully managed low-code platform.

## Sentences

There are no strict requirements for sentence source except that sentences should be in English. You can choose to copy some open-licensed texts from the Internet, generate them with LLM once or on the fly, or even write them yourself. You choose your strategy.

## F.A.Q.

1. _Is it OK to share your solutions publicly?_
   Yes, the questions are not prescriptive, the process and discussion around the code is the valuable part. You do the work, you own the code. Given we are asking you to give up your time, it is entirely reasonable for you to keep and use your solution as you see fit.

2. _Should I do X?_
   For any value of X, it is up to you, we intentionally leave the problem a little open-ended and will leave it up to you to provide us with what you see as important. Just remember the rough time frame of the project. If it is going to take you a couple of days, it isn't essential.

3. _Something is ambiguous, and I don't know what to do?_
   The first thing is: don't get stuck. We really don't want to trip you up intentionally, we are just attempting to see how you approach problems. That said, there are intentional ambiguities in the specifications, mainly to see how you fill in those gaps, and how you make design choices.

## What's next?

Once you're done, send us a confirmation email. After you submit your code, we will contact you to discuss next steps.

Good luck! ðŸ’ª
