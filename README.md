# Next.js Coding Challenge

Hi 👋! Thank you for taking the time to participate in this coding challenge to develop a web app in Next.js. The following task is going to show us your skills, experience and coding style. Please remember that you can use as many tools as you feel comfortable with.

## What to expect?

We expect that it will take ~3 hours to complete this exercise. While you're welcome to take as much extra time as you'd like to clean up or improve the codebase, it's not required. If there's something that you would have done in a "real" production environment, feel free to add details to your `README`, so we can better understand what next steps you'd take.

## What we are looking for?

- **Treat it like production code**. Develop your software in the same way that you would for any code that is intended to be deployed to production. This includes some of the following:
    - Adding caching, monitoring, state management, type safety, support for tests, thinking of security etc. Even though these may not be required for this simple exercise, we'd like to see this as this codebase would be extended over the coming months with multiple different developers
    - Writing code in TypeScript if that's your normal approach
    - Creating detailed commit messages, which represent discrete sets of work
    - Providing sample e2e, integration, and/or unit tests
- **Document your choices**. Whenever you're complete with this project, please document the choices that you've made in your project `README`.

## How to submit?

You can do this however you see fit - you can email us a tarball, a pointer to download your code from somewhere or just a link to a source control repository. Make sure your submission includes a small `README`, documenting any assumptions, simplifications and/or choices you made, as well as a short description of how to run the code and/or tests. Finally, to help us review your code, please split your commit history into sensible chunks.

## Challenge

Develop an application that is a real-time writing competition ✍ platform️. Each person who visits a page can join a typing competition and spar with other contestants. On the main page, the application should render a current sentence to write, a time left to the next round, an input and a table with the real updated current competitor results. Its structure can look like this:

| Live progress      | Player name | Words per minute | Accuracy |
| :----------------- | :---------- | ---------------: | -------: |
| Lazy fox jumped \| | super typer |               30 |     0.97 |

Please add the following features (as many as you can):

1. Real-time updated results and player stats. When a player joins a competition he/she should be shown in the main player's table with other currently playing contestants. The table should show live data, for example "Live progress" column should show the currently typed-in text of the given player.
1. The game should consist of fixed-time rounds. In each round all currently playing people are presented with one sentence to type in. After the round time passes players are presented with the new sentence.
1. Show metrics and stats for the currently active players.
    - Words per minute - how fast the player correctly types in words. Words with errors shouldn't count.
    - Accuracy - how often the player hits the correct key. It should be the value of correctly typed-in characters to all characters in the given sentence. Feel free to extend the calculation if needed to handle edge cases.
1. Saving player results. When the same player joins the server their stats are loaded.
1. Presenting a simple loading/error states
1. Sorting the table by columns, pagination, and changing the number of rows displayed (locally).
1. Updating the current URL table sort, so we get the same sorting results when the page gets refreshed.
1. And adding anything else that you think will be useful for the user...

_Note: There are no formal "UX" designs for this exercise, so it's okay if it doesn't look polished._

## Realtime APIs

There are no strict requirements on the backend. Pick a tool that you feel will work best in this scenario. Keep in mind that it should work well with Next.js. It could be anything from self hosted server to a fully managed low-code platform.

## Sentences

There are no strict requirements for sentence source except that sentences should be in English. You can choose to copy some open-licensed texts from the Internet, generate them with LLM once or on the fly, or even write them yourself. You choose your strategy.

## F.A.Q.

1. _Is it OK to share your solutions publicly?_
   Yes, the questions are not prescriptive, the process and discussion around the code is the valuable part. You do the work, you own the code. Given we are asking you to give up your time, it is entirely reasonable for you to keep and use your solution as you see fit.

2. _Should I do X?_
   For any value of X, it is up to you, we intentionally leave the problem a little open-ended and will leave it up to you to provide us with what you see as important. Just remember the rough time frame of the project. If it is going to take you a couple of days, it isn't essential.

3. _Something is ambiguous, and I don't know what to do?_
   The first thing is: don't get stuck. We really don't want to trip you up intentionally, we are just attempting to see how you approach problems. That said, there are intentional ambiguities in the specifications, mainly to see how you fill in those gaps, and how you make design choices.

## What's next?

Once you're done, send us a confirmation email. After you submit your code, we will contact you to discuss next steps.

Good luck! 💪
